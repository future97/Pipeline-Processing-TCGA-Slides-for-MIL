## Overview

This repo provides ***a complete and detailed tutorial*** for users who is is intending to ***process TCGA Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) for downstream computational tasks***, such as WSI classification and survival analysis (basically with multiple-instance learning (MIL) as the learning paradiagm). Most functionalities of this repo is inherented from [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM). 

üí° A quick overview of **what convenience** this repo could provide for you is given as follows:
- **Step-by-step instructions to download complete TCGA data**, including WSIs and corresponding label of interest. This is not presented in CLAM.
- **Detailed steps to process WSIs**, including WSI segmentation & patching and patch feature extraction. Notebooks are provided to show the details and notices that you need to pay attention to when using CLAM for WSI preprocessing.
- **More alternative pretrained models for patch feature extraction**, currently with support of [truncated ResNet50 (CLAM)](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM), [ResNet18 w/ SimCL (DSMIL)](https://github.com/binli123/dsmil-wsi), [CTransPath](https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath), [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), [PLIP](https://github.com/PathologyFoundation/plip), and [CONCH](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CONCH).  

üìù This repo is developed from [***PseMix***](https://github.com/liupei101/PseMix), previously. Now it has been moved out as an individual project for maintaining convenience. It is *on updating*. 

Feel free to post your issue in this repo if you encounter any problems.

## Walkthrough

Here show you how to use this repo:
- S01: [Downloading slides from TCGA websites](./S01-Downloading-Slides-from-TCGA.ipynb). It shows you, step by step, how to obtain the data you want from TCGA. 
- S02: [Reorganizing slides at patient-level](./S02-Reorganizing-Slides-at-Patient-Level.ipynb). It provides the code for organizing slides at patient-level, and show you how to get the useful label data (slide-level) that you would possibly utilize in downstream computational tasks. 
- S03: [Segmenting and patching slides](./S03-Segmenting-and-Patching-Slides.ipynb). It shows you the complete procedures and results of tissue segmentation and patching. Also, the basic knowledge of WSI structure is given.
- S04: [Extracting patch features](./S04-Extracting-Patch-Features.ipynb). It shows you the complete procedures and results of patch feature extraction. 6+ pretained models are supported and can be easily used in this step. 


Some notes:
- It is strongly recommended to use *CONCH* in patch feature extraction (S04); if you cannot use CONCH due to limited access rights, *CTransPath and PLIP* are good alternatives (both are free for use). Their usage is provided in [scripts](https://github.com/liupei101/Pipeline-Processing-TCGA-Slides-for-MIL/tools/scripts). The truncated ResNet50 and ResNet18 w/ SimCL are NOT recommended for patch feature extraction. 


## Acknowledgement
We thank [CLAM team](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) for contributing such an efficient and easy-to-use tool for WSI preprocessing, and [TCGA team](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga) for making WSI data publicly-available to facilitate research.
